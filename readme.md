# Hacktoberfest
Follow these steps to create your first pull request and embark on your journey to a free, awesome shirt! Oh, and becoming a programmer too! :) I will be approving all pull requests! Please, STAR this repository and share it with your friends!

## Downloads
Download these two programs:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads): the industry standard version control system (keep all the default installation options)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): the most popular text-editor

## Creating a Pull Request
1. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com) account, if you haven't already, and connect it with [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).
2. You can `Star` and `Fork` this repository by clicking the buttons found in the upper right hand corner.
3. After clicking the `Fork` button and the page has finished loading, click on the green `clone or download` button and copy the link that is given after clicking the button.
4. Navigate to the folder in which you would like to have a local copy of the repo. You can do this by right clicking inside the folder and clicking on `Git Bash Here` or by navigating to the folder via commandline. Ensure you know where youre `cloning` the repo to! 
5. To clone the repo, type `git clone <link>` where `<link>` is a placeholder for the link you were given earlier. To paste your link, you can use `shift + insert` on Windows and `insert` on Mac. Cloning a repo will create a local version of the code on your machine. Whatever you do to this code will not effect the code online until you `push` ... well get into that later.
7. Now that the repo is on your machine, time to code! Open the folder in Visual Studio Code by either dragging the folder onto the icon or opening the folder from Visual Studio Code's menu.
8. As this is a tutorial on how to create a pull request, lets keep what you have to do simple! All you have to do is add a new bullet point in the `Winners` section of this document with the following format `FirstName LastName <GitHubProfileLink>`.
9. Once you have completed the task in step 8 and saved your work, you're ready to begin the `push` and `pull request` process to upload your code to the live repo for all to see!
10. In the terminal you opened in step 4, begin by checking the status of your branch, which is currently master, by typing `git status`. This will tell you what files were modified, added, or deleted along with if any changes have been made to the live master repo.
> /!\ Note: As this file was already included in the repo, you do not have to add it to git. However, if you are adding a file to the repo you can use the command `git add .` to stage all files within the current directory. If you would like to add a single file to the repo, use `git add <FileName>`.
11. When adding your code to a repo, also known as comitting code, you must include a message. This message should be a brief description of what the changes in code is doing. You can do so by using the command `git commit -am "<message>"`.  Where `message` is your message and the `"` on either side are required!
12. Once you have comitted your code, you can use `git status` again to ensure that everything has been included with the commit. Once you are sure everything is ready to go, you can push!
13. To push your code, use the command `git push origin master`. This will push our code the live `master` branch.
14. Once you have pushed your code, go back to GitHub and open the repo in which you pushed to. There you should see an alert to create a pull request using the push you just did! To create a pull request, click the prompt!
15. Once you click this prompt, add a comment if you'd like. Submit it. Depending on the repo, there might be pull request comment guides. As this is for teaching, we have none!

Once you have completed the above code... CONGRATULATIONS! You have successfully created a pull request! 

You are now on your way to receive a cool shirt after doing three more of these!

Happy coding! If you have any questions, comment on the issue and I will try to get back to you. Also, try Googling your question and see if you can't find the answer on your own. :)
